# Node.js Express with gRPC Implementation

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Node.js project using Express and gRPC. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how RESTful APIs can work alongside gRPC to provide efficient communication between microservices, showcasing the strengths of both technologies in a unified application.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on:

1. **Express.js for RESTful APIs**: Implement RESTful endpoints using Express.js, providing HTTP-based APIs for external clients.
2. **gRPC for Efficient Microservice Communication**: Implement gRPC services for internal communication between microservices, showcasing the high performance and type safety of gRPC.
3. **Combining REST and gRPC**: Learn how to use both REST and gRPC in a single application, leveraging the benefits of each for different use cases.

## Content

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Express.js REST API**:
   - Implemented CRUD operations for resources, demonstrating how to build scalable and maintainable REST APIs with Express.js.
   - Middleware setup for logging, error handling, and request validation.

2. **gRPC Service Implementation**:
   - gRPC services set up using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) to define the service interfaces.
   - Example implementation of gRPC server and client for internal communication between microservices.

3. **Combining REST and gRPC**:
   - Example use cases where REST and gRPC can work together.
   - Routing requests based on the client needs: REST for external clients and gRPC for internal microservice interactions.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of **Express.js** and **gRPC**.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/javadkavossi/Nodejs-Express-gRPC.git
